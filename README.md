# LMR Competition Participation

## Overview
This repository documents our participation in the LMR (Lets make a Robot) competition. Our team has developed two distinct robots to compete in different challenges: an autonomous maze-solving robot and a robot equipped with a robotic arm.

## Autonomous Maze-Solving Robot
Our autonomous maze-solving robot is designed to navigate through a maze without human intervention. Using a combination of sensors, algorithms, and precise motor control, our robot can analyze its environment and make decisions to efficiently navigate from the starting point to the endpoint of the maze.

### Features:
- Utilizes sensors such as ultrasonic sensors, infrared sensors for environment perception.
- Employs motor control mechanisms for precise movement and navigation.

## Robot with a Robotic Arm
The second robot we've developed features a robotic arm that is controlled by a PS4 controller. This setup allows for intuitive and real-time control of the robotic arm's movements, enabling various applications ranging from manipulation tasks to interactive demonstrations.

### Features:
- Integrates a robotic arm with multiple degrees of freedom.
- Utilizes a PlayStation 4 (PS4) controller for intuitive and user-friendly control.
- Capable of climbing ramps of up to a maximum incline of 35 degrees.
- Utilizes MG966 and SG90 servos for the robotic arm's movements.


## Repository Structure
